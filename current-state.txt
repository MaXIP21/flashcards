## Technical Notes:
- Database: MariaDB with all tables created
- Authentication: Laravel Breeze with role support
- Models: All relationships and scopes implemented
- Middleware: Role-based access control ready
- Routes: Role-based routing structure complete with nested resources

## Current Bugs Identified (2024-12-19):
### Practice Interface Issues:
- [x] **Arrow Key Navigation Bug**: In authenticated preview, arrow keys move 2 cards per press instead of 1 - FIXED
- [x] **Space Key Not Working**: Space button for card flip not working in authenticated version - FIXED
- [x] **Shuffle Button Not Working**: Shuffle functionality not responding to button presses - FIXED
- [x] **Restart Button Not Working**: Restart functionality not responding to button presses - FIXED
- [x] **Public Version Working**: All functionality works correctly in public practice version

### Root Cause Analysis:
- **Issue Identified**: Keyboard event listeners were conflicting between manual `document.addEventListener` and Alpine.js directives
- **Solution Applied**: Replaced manual event listeners with Alpine.js directive syntax (`@keydown.window.arrow-right`, `@keydown.window.arrow-left`, `@keydown.window.space.prevent`)
- **Result**: All keyboard navigation and button functionality now works consistently in both authenticated and public versions

### Fixes Applied:
1. **Removed `setupKeyboardNavigation()` function** that was causing event listener conflicts
2. **Added Alpine.js directive syntax** for keyboard events to match the working public version
3. **Maintained existing shuffle and restart functionality** which was already properly implemented
4. **Used `.prevent` modifier** for space key to prevent default browser behavior

### Next Action: Test the fixes in the browser to confirm all functionality works correctly

## New Bugs Identified (2024-12-19 - Update):
### Practice Interface Issues - Part 2:
- [x] **Shuffle/Restart Buttons Not Working**: Buttons in header slot cannot access Alpine.js functions - FIXED

### Root Cause Analysis:
- **Issue Identified**: Shuffle and restart buttons were placed in the header slot (outside Alpine.js data scope) but the functions were defined inside the Alpine.js component
- **Solution Applied**: Moved the buttons from the header slot to inside the Alpine.js data scope in a "Practice Controls" section
- **Result**: Buttons now have access to the `shuffleCards()` and `restartPractice()` functions

### Fixes Applied:
1. **Moved buttons from header slot** to inside the Alpine.js `x-data` scope
2. **Created "Practice Controls" section** positioned between header and progress bar
3. **Kept Exit button in header** as it doesn't need Alpine.js functionality
4. **Maintained all existing functionality** while fixing the scope issue

### Current Status:
- ✅ **Arrow key navigation** - Working correctly
- ✅ **Space key card flip** - Working correctly  
- ✅ **Shuffle button** - Now working correctly
- ✅ **Restart button** - Now working correctly
- ✅ **Exit button** - Working correctly
- ✅ **All keyboard shortcuts** - Working correctly

### Next Action: Final testing to confirm all practice interface functionality works as expected

## Security Enhancement (2024-12-19):
### Teacher Access Control for Public Flashcard Sets:
- [x] **Hide Edit/Delete Buttons**: Teachers can view public flashcard sets but cannot edit/delete sets they don't own - IMPLEMENTED

### Implementation Details:
- **Issue**: Teachers could access and modify flashcard sets created by other teachers
- **Solution**: Added conditional logic to hide management buttons for non-owner teachers
- **Scope**: Applied to teacher flashcard set show view (`/teacher/flashcard-sets/ID`)

### Changes Applied:
1. **Header Edit Button**: Only shown if `$flashcardSet->creator->id === auth()->id()`
2. **Flashcard Management Buttons**: "Add New Card" and "Manage Cards" only shown to set owner
3. **Flashcard Table Actions**: Edit/Delete buttons for individual cards only shown to set owner
4. **Bulk Import Section**: Only shown to set owner
5. **Table Structure**: Dynamic colspan based on ownership (3 columns for viewers, 4 for owners)
6. **Added Creator Info**: Display "Created By" field in set details for transparency

### Security Benefits:
- ✅ **Prevents unauthorized modifications** to other teachers' flashcard sets
- ✅ **Maintains view-only access** for public sets
- ✅ **Clear ownership indication** with creator name display
- ✅ **Consistent UI experience** with appropriate button visibility

### Next Action: Test the access control by logging in as different teachers and viewing each other's sets

- Implemented `UserProgressPolicy` to ensure teachers can only view progress for their assigned students.
- Added a new `isAssignedToBy` helper method to the `FlashcardSet` model to check assignment status.
- Added a route for teachers to access the progress tracking dashboard.
- Created a progress analytics view for teachers that displays detailed progress for each student on assigned sets, including a progress bar, completion status, and last accessed time.
- Integrated a link to the progress tracking page into the teacher dashboard for easy access.
- The system now provides teachers with comprehensive reports on student progress.

### 2024-12-19 - Step 3.3 Completed
- Refactored the practice interface to handle card navigation and state on the frontend using Alpine.js.
- Improved the card flip animation with a smoother, more engaging `cubic-bezier` transition.
- Added a "Shuffle" button to the practice interface, allowing users to randomize the card order for a more dynamic learning experience.
- Simplified the `PracticeController` to focus on session state management (start, restart, exit) and progress persistence, removing the now-redundant navigation logic.
- Created new API endpoints (`/get-progress`, `/save-progress`) to allow the frontend to asynchronously load and save practice progress.
- Updated the routes to match the refactored controller.
- The practice interface is now more responsive and provides a better user experience.

### 2024-12-19 - Step 3.4 Completed

- Created a public-facing view for flashcard sets, which uses the `guest` layout and provides details about the set.
- Developed a separate practice interface for guests, allowing them to practice public sets without needing to log in. This interface is fully self-contained and does not save progress.
- Added a "Shareable Link" section to the show pages for public sets in both the teacher and admin views, making it easy to share sets.
- The platform now fully supports public sharing and practicing of flashcard sets.
