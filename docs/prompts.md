```
I upgraded the laravel stack can you update the Plan.md and update what is necessary  
```

```
can you cut the project into implementation steps and create and imlementation.md from the steps to make it easyer for you to implement it .
```

```
Can you please implement the Phase 1 from implementation.md and log all the progress into current-state.txt the log should be enough to continue the implementation in case the process stops. 
```

```
Can you please continue the implementation with Phase 2 from implementation.md and log all the progress into current-state.txt the log should be enough to continue the implementation in case the process stops. 
```

```
Can you please continue the implementation of Phase 2 from implementation.md please also check the state of the implementation in current-state, please log all the progress into current-state.txt the log should be enough to continue the implementation in case the process stops. 
```

```
Can you please continue with the implementation of Phase 3 from implementation.md please also check the state of the implementation in current-state, please log all the progress into current-state.txt the log should be enough to continue the implementation in case the process stops. 
```

```
I tested the project, and I run into some errors. 
1st error: it seems when a teacher tries to create a new set it displays an empty web page, however if an administrator tries to create it it works fine.

2nd error: when I made a set public it also gave me an empty page 

Can you check the errors and let me know how would you mitigate it please don't change a code for now just create a plan.  
```

```
it seems the public sets are still not displaying anything this is one of them @https://laradev2.peterbacsai.com/public/sets/CrEcazwF1w  can you check what can be the issue 
```

```
