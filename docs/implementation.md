## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Migrations Structure
```sql
-- Users table with roles
users: id, name, email, password, role, email_verified_at, created_at, updated_at

-- Flashcard sets
flashcard_sets: id, title, description, source_language, target_language, is_public, unique_identifier, created_by, created_at, updated_at

-- Individual flashcards
flashcards: id, flashcard_set_id, source_word, target_word, position, created_at, updated_at

-- Assignments
assignments: id, teacher_id, student_id, flashcard_set_id, assigned_at, due_date, created_at, updated_at

-- User progress tracking
user_progress: id, user_id, flashcard_set_id, current_position, completed, last_accessed, created_at, updated_at
```

### Key Controllers to Create

2. `FlashcardController` - Manage individual flashcards
3. `PracticeController` - Handle flashcard practice sessions
4. `AssignmentController` - Manage teacher-student assignments
5. `ProgressController` - Track user progress
6. `DashboardController` - User dashboards
7. `UserController` - User management (extend existing)

### Key Views to Create
1. `flashcard-sets/` - Set management views
2. `flashcards/` - Card management views
3. `practice/` - Practice interface views
4. `assignments/` - Assignment management views
5. `dashboard/` - User dashboard views
6. `components/` - Reusable Blade components

### Alpine.js Components

## Notes for Implementation

1. **Start with Phase 1**: Complete foundation before moving to features
2. **Test frequently**: Write tests as you implement features
3. **Use Git branches**: Create feature branches for each major component
4. **Follow Laravel conventions**: Use Laravel's naming conventions and patterns
5. **Document as you go**: Keep implementation notes and update documentation
6. **Iterate quickly**: Build MVP features first, then enhance
7. **Security first**: Implement authorization and validation early
8. **Mobile responsive**: Test on mobile devices throughout development
