- User satisfaction scores

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **Database Performance**: Mitigated by proper indexing and query optimization
- **Scalability**: Laravel's built-in caching and queue systems
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Regular security audits and updates

### Business Risks
- **User Adoption**: Clear value proposition and intuitive UX
- **Content Quality**: Teacher verification and rating systems
- **Competition**: Focus on unique features and user experience

## Conclusion

This plan provides a comprehensive roadmap for building a robust, scalable flashcard learning platform. The phased approach ensures steady progress while maintaining code quality and user experience. The modular architecture allows for future enhancements and easy maintenance.
